# How It Works.

The urls to be scraped are stored within the text document "urls_data.txt".
Each url should be on a separate line, 

The script will parse the associated links within that page, looking for links that are labeled with either "Volume", "Mirror", and follow those links and store the result in an array.

Afterward, the links will be followed, and opened in MSEdge or another browser to allow you to solve captcha or use browser extensions like FastForward.
